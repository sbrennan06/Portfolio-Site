            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For the past sixteen years, I have built my career in real estate by specializing in database administration, analytics, 
                    and lease administration. In my current role as a manager, I oversee accounts and staff while ensuring data accuracy and 
                    operational efficiency. This work has strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills, and it 
                    has given me deep experience in handling large, complex data systems. My long-term career goal is to continue developing 
                    these skills and apply them in the evolving field of data science. I aspire to transition into a data scientist position, 
                    where I can leverage my background in analytics to uncover insights, support data-driven decision-making, and create 
                    innovative solutions that improve organizational outcomes. By combining my real estate expertise with advanced data science 
                    tools, I aim to add measurable value and grow as a professional.</li>
